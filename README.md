# Taskbook Python GUI

Like most suprising and intering things, this was created during a night of alcohol and really good pizza.

I use this constenly for keeping track of everything:
 - Design work; Blender, Illustrator and Photoshop
 - Peronsal programming projects (like this one)
 - Work, tracking progress of tasks and recording development.

# The Crazy Night

On this shocker of a night I was getting overwheled with work and and I was thinking what could smooth my work flow and not fill my terminal with extra output that I could get lost in.

So to take a break from work and develop a cool user interface for an amazing program.

I know this program is in python, is really slow and is a mess, but I was hoping that this would incourage people to contribute to this mess.
(to make a effective mess)
