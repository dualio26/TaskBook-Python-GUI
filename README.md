# Taskbook Python GUI

Like most suprising and intering things, this was created during a night of alcohol and really good pizza.

I use this constenly for keeping track of everything:
 - Design work; Blender, Illustrator and Photoshop
 - Peronsal programming projects (like this one)
 - Work, tracking progress of tasks and recording development.
